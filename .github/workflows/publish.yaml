# In order for Deploy to Github Pages to work, some settings on the repository need to be configured
# - on settings/pages, Build and deployment: source needs to be `Github Actions`
# - that will create a `github-pages` environment (on settings/environments) with one protection rule
#   it defaults to allowing just the `main` branch to do deployments
# - add a tag rule allowing `v*` tags to use the `github-pages` environment
